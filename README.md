# Fitz-Hugh-Nagumo_MATLAB_simulation
This MATLAB code is designed to solve and analyze the Fitz-Hugh-Nagumo equations, which are a set of nonlinear equations that can be used to model the dynamics of a neuron's action potential firing.

Description:
This MATLAB code is designed to solve and analyze the Fitz-Hugh-Nagumo equations, which are a set of nonlinear equations that can be used to model the dynamics of a neuron's action potential firing. Specifically, the equations describe the electrical activity of a neuron's membrane potential, as well as the activity of a neuron's slow recovery current, w.

The code begins by initializing the parameters of the Fitz-Hugh-Nagumo equation, as well as a range of V values that will be used to compute the nullclines and equilibria. The program then calculates the nullclines and equilibria of the system, and determines whether the system is stable or unstable, and whether it has oscillations.

The code then numerically solves the system, produces vectors to make a vector field, and plots the results onto a phase plane. The phase plane includes the nullclines, the trajectory of the system, a direction field, and the equilibria. The code also plots the numerical solution against time.

The use of this script can help to understand the neurological action potential firing process. By analyzing the phase plane, it is easy to see how the different components of the system interact with one another and determine the system's overall behavior. Additionally, by plotting the numerical solution against time, it is possible to see how the system evolves over time and observe any oscillations that may be present.

This code can be used to gain a better understanding of how neurons fire action potentials, as the Fitz-Hugh-Nagumo equations are a commonly used model for this activity. By plotting the phase plane and numerical solution, the user can observe how the various components of the system interact with each other and determine the system's overall behavior.

The phase plane plot can be used to observe the nullclines, trajectory, direction field, and equilibria of the system. The nullclines can be used to determine where the system will be stable or unstable, and the trajectory of the system can be used to observe its oscillations. Additionally, the direction field can be used to understand the flow of the system, and the equilibria can be used to determine the resting state of the neuron.

The numerical solution plot can also be used to observe how the system evolves over time. This can give insight into how the system is affected by external stimuli and how it changes in response. Additionally, oscillations can be observed in this plot, which can help to determine the overall behavior of the system.

Overall, this code can be used to gain a better understanding of how neurons fire action potentials and how the components of the system interact with each other. By observing the phase plane and numerical solution, the user can gain insight into the behavior of the system and how it is affected by external stimuli.
